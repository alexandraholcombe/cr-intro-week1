        <p class="about">My name is Allie Holcombe, and that is not a picture of me.  I was unable to find any on this PC, so I am temporarily using a sim I made back when I was super into the Sims 3.</p>
        <p>I come to Epicodus from a retail sales leadership position and most of an undergrad degree in history.  In January, a friend of mine with a degree in theater tech started working at a startup as a junior developer.  When I asked how she got there, she told me about her experiences at a coding bootcamp.  For the first time since leaving college, a new path forward caught my attention.</p>
        <p><span class="quote-this"> "I can do that," I thought.</span>  "I used to enjoy HTML and CSS so much!" Unfortunately, with college work and a full-time job, my time spent learning how to make Wordpress themes and figuring out how Joomla worked dwindled to no time at all.</p>
        <p>After several months of investigating bootcamps and learn-to-code programs in Washington, California, and Colorado, as well as studying Javascript to pass one of the admissions exams, I found Epicodus.  The <em>flipped-classroom</em> and <em>pairing</em> model sold me.</p>
